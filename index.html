    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>It's time to explore new frontiers. Two decades üßô in the pharmaceutical sciences has been exciting for sure but
        there is more to be learnt. Tech is where it snows ‚òÉÔ∏è It is everywhere and will surely be there in the future
        üîÆ I like the future and plan to be there, so honing skills within tech and
        blend it with knowledge gained from lifescience üß¨ seems like a good place for future self to be.</p>
